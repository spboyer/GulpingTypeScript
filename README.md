# GulpingTypeScript

Simple example project that you can use for looking at how to leverge gulp.js to compile
TypeScript.

It also adds the ability of my nuget package [kmon](https://github.com/henriksen/kmon). Be sure to set the `--server` parameter in the project.json to `web` for Windows or `kestrel` for Linux or OSX.
